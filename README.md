📘 OOP Assignment – Python

This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python through two activities:

Book Class Design 🏗️

Polymorphism Challenge 🎭

🚀 Activity 1: Book Class

A Book class with attributes: title, author, pages, and price.

Methods include:

read() → Simulates reading the book.

get_summary() → Returns a short description.

An EBook subclass that inherits from Book and adds:

Attribute: file_size.

Methods:

Overridden read() → Customized for eBooks.

download() → Simulates downloading the eBook.

🔹 Concepts Covered:

Classes and objects

Constructors (__init__)

Inheritance

Polymorphism (method overriding)

🚀 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge

A base class Vehicle with a method move().

Subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat) override the move() method to behave differently:

Car.move() → "Driving 🚗"

Plane.move() → "Flying ✈️"

Boat.move() → "Sailing 🚤"

🔹 Concepts Covered:

Inheritance

Polymorphism (same method name, different behavior)
